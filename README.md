### This was an online meetup 

where [Antonija](https://meetantonija.com/) coded a memory card game starting from scratch using vanilla JS for game logic and Vite for bundling.

### More about this event

The goal of this event is to showcase the best practices at Kodiraonica, a coding school founded by Antonija. By coding a game we show how we teach at coding school. You can read more about the event [here](https://www.meetup.com/kodiraonica/events/285121501/).

### More about the game

 * Game starts with the timer at the top.
 * User has limited time to get all the matches.
 * If match is made, matched cards stay open.
 * If match is not made, clicked cards get closed except the matched cards.
 * After three failed matches, game is lost and reset for a new round.
 * When all matches are made, game is won and reset for a new round.

This project has no commercial purposes and was free to attend for anyone interested in Javascript or Kodiraonica.

### How to run the game

 1. `npm install`
 2. `npm run dev`
 3.  open `localhost`

### Features left to implement
 * leaderboard associated with either localStorage or even database
 * adding a sound when the card is matched
